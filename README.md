This repository contains a COBOL program demonstrating a potential data overwrite bug when working with tables.  The bug occurs in the `PROCEDURE DIVISION`, specifically within the loop handling the addition of items to the `WS-ITEM-TABLE`. The problem arises if the `WS-ITEM-COUNT` variable is not properly managed.  The solution provided demonstrates how to resolve the issue, preventing overwrites and ensuring data integrity.
